			<h1>About Anna</h1>
				<div class="annas-about"><p>Upon graduating from Indiana University with a Bachelors degree in Sociology, Anna knew immediately that New York City would be her new home. While living in Manhattan with 4 other roommates, she began a career in tech, first working as a digital marketer at a app development firm, followed by Customer Adovcate in one of New York's leading Bitcoin exchange. Ready for an adventure and culture shock, she moved to Tel Aviv, Israel where she didn't stray far from her tech roots. Although her inital role was Sales at a Saas startup, her managers took notice of her technical talents and began having her create, film, and edit all company videos. Realzing that she loved putting peices together and having projects come alive right in front of her, she knew web development was the most logical step. Following her dreams, Anna decided that it was time to return home, NYC, and began her journey at General Assembly.</p></div>
